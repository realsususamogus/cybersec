Hi, I am Chandi.  
I am strong in communication, collaboration and crisis management along with actively developing my programming expertise.  
I value protecting people and organisations from harm and helping them prepare for the future.  
Cybersecurity excites me because of its constant innovation, its urgency, and its growing significance in today’s world.  
I believe I can play a major role in cybersecurity through problem solving, vulneribility identification and safegaurding practices.
